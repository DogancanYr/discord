## `better-folders` 

[direct download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadenscott/bbb/master/better-folders.plugin.js?)

BetterFolders applies a folder's icon colour to its background when expanded. In my opinion, this makes it far easier
to recognize the boundaries between folders, and see what folder you are in when it takes up the whole height.

**Caveats**:

- Background colour will not automatically update when adjusting folder colours.
  Closing the folder and re-opening it will fix this issue.
